# ARP Spoofing Script

This Python script allows you to perform ARP spoofing attacks on a local network. ARP spoofing, also known as ARP poisoning, is a technique used to intercept network traffic between two hosts by tricking them into sending data through the attacker's machine. This script is provided for educational and testing purposes only. Please use it responsibly and only in controlled environments with proper authorization. Unauthorized use of ARP spoofing is illegal and unethical.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Scapy library

You can install Scapy using pip:

```pip install scapy```
Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```https://github.com/Hackerjedi666/ArpSpoofer.git```
2. Change into the project directory:
   ```cd ArpSpoofer```
3. Run the script
   ```python arpSpoofer.py```
4. The script will prompt you to enter the target IP address and the gateway IP address.Once you provide the IP addresses, the ARP spoofing attack     
   will begin.
   
*Important Note*
This script is for educational purposes only. ARP spoofing is considered malicious and illegal in many contexts. Be sure to use it responsibly and only on networks you have permission to test on. Unauthorized ARP spoofing is a violation of computer security laws and can lead to serious consequences.
